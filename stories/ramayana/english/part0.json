"🌺<u>**The Bala Kanda – The Beginning of the Ramayana**</u> <p> The **Ramayana** was written by the great sage **Valmiki** in ancient times. It tells the divine story of **Lord Rama**, who is considered an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, and his journey filled with duty, love, and devotion.</p> <p> The Ramayana is divided into **seven parts**, known as **Kandas**. They are: <br> 1. **Bala Kanda** – The Childhood and Marriage of Rama <br> 2. **Ayodhya Kanda** – Rama’s Exile <br> 3. **Aranya Kanda** – Life in the Forest <br> 4. **Kishkindha Kanda** – Meeting Hanuman and Sugriva <br> 5. **Sundara Kanda** – Hanuman’s Journey to Lanka <br> 6. **Yuddha Kanda** – The Great War in Lanka <br> 7. **Uttara Kanda** – Rama’s Return and Later Life <br> </p> <p> The **Bala Kanda** is the *first part* of this great story. It is the beginning — the dawn of Rama’s divine journey. It tells how **Rama was born** in the royal family of Ayodhya to **King Dasaratha** and **Queen Kausalya**, after the king performed a holy sacrifice to be blessed with sons. Rama grew up with his three brothers — **Lakshmana**, **Bharata**, and **Satrughna** — all brave, wise, and loving towards each other.</p> <p> In Bala Kanda, we also meet the great sage **Vishwamitra**, who takes young Rama and Lakshmana to protect his sacred rituals from demons. With the sage’s blessings, Rama performs many heroic deeds — defeating the mighty demoness **Tataka** and breaking the great **bow of Lord Shiva** at the court of King **Janaka**. It is here that Rama wins the hand of the beautiful and virtuous **Sita**, daughter of Janaka, marking the beginning of a divine union that will shape the rest of the Ramayana.</p> <p> This part of the Ramayana is filled with wonder, wisdom, and purity. It shows how goodness, courage, and respect for dharma can conquer all evils. Bala Kanda sets the stage for Rama’s journey — from a young prince to a hero whose life becomes a guide for all of humanity.</p>",
"**<u>The First Chapter of Bala Kanda: The Wonderful Life of Sri Rama</u>** <p>Saint Valmiki, a wise and kind sage, once asked Narada, a divine messenger who knew everything about the past, present, and future, if there was a person who had every good quality — someone strong, wise, gentle, and truthful. He wished to know about a man who never got angry or jealous, always did what was right, and was loved by everyone.</p>  <p>Narada was happy with this question and said that such a person was Sri Rama, born in the royal family of King Ikshvaku. Rama was brave, handsome, kind, and spoke sweetly. He always followed the path of truth and righteousness (dharma) and cared deeply for all living beings. His courage and goodness were greater than even the gods, and everyone loved him.</p>  <p>King Dasaratha, Rama’s father, wanted to make Rama the next king. But because of two promises he had made to Queen Kaikeyi, he had to send Rama away to the forest for fourteen years. Obeying his father without complaint, Rama went into exile with his loving wife Sita and his loyal brother Lakshmana. In the forest of Chitrakuta, they lived a simple and peaceful life, like divine beings.</p>  <p>While in the forest, Rama defeated many demons like Viradha, Khara, Trisira, and Dushana, protecting the sages and keeping peace. But the demoness Surpanakha caused great trouble — her actions led to the kidnapping of Sita by the demon king Ravana. Heartbroken but determined, Rama set out to rescue her. With the help of his faithful friends Sugriva, Hanuman, and an army of vanaras (monkey warriors), Rama crossed many hardships and challenges.</p>  <p>Through great strength, courage, and the blessings of the gods, Rama defeated Ravana, brought Sita back safely, and restored peace and goodness. When Rama returned to Ayodhya, he was crowned king. Under his rule, everyone was happy — there was no fear, sickness, or sorrow. People lived in joy and honesty, like in the golden age (Krita Yuga). Rama’s rule became the perfect example of justice, kindness, and duty.</p>  <p>The story of Rama, as told by Narada to Valmiki, is sacred and brings goodness to everyone who listens to it. Those who hear, read, or chant it are blessed with long life, happiness, and good fortune, and gain respect in this life and peace in the next.</p>  <p>Thus ends the first chapter (sarga) of Bala Kanda from the holy <i>Ramayana</i> written by sage Valmiki, describing the noble life and great deeds of Sri Rama, from his birth to his victorious return to Ayodhya.</p>",
"**<u>The Second Chapter of Bala Kanda: How Sage Valmiki Was Inspired to Write the Ramayana</u>** <p>One peaceful morning, sage Valmiki went to the river Tamasa to take his bath. As he walked along the riverbank, he saw a very sad sight. A hunter shot an arrow and killed a male krauncha bird (a type of heron) while it was with its mate. The female bird cried loudly in sorrow for her lost companion. Seeing this painful scene, Valmiki felt deep sadness and pity in his heart. Out of that feeling, he suddenly spoke a verse — a beautiful sloka — expressing how wrong and cruel the hunter’s act was. This became the first poetic verse ever created in the world.</p>  <p>Just then, Lord Brahma, the creator of the universe, appeared before Valmiki. The sage was filled with respect and welcomed Brahma with prayers and offerings. Lord Brahma told Valmiki that the verse he had spoken was not ordinary — it was special and full of truth and emotion. Brahma then blessed Valmiki and said, “Compose the story of Lord Rama — just as you heard from Narada — in the same poetic form. Let it be truthful, beautiful, and everlasting. As long as the mountains, rivers, and the earth remain, your Ramayana will live on.”</p>  <p>After receiving this divine blessing, Valmiki returned to his hermitage with a peaceful mind. He sat with his students and began to think deeply about Lord Rama’s life. With love, devotion, and wisdom, he started writing the great epic — the Ramayana — in beautiful verses filled with meaning and melody. This sacred poem tells of Rama’s courage, goodness, and his victory over the demon king Ravana. It was destined to live forever, teaching and inspiring people for all time.</p>  <p>Thus ends the second chapter (sarga) of Bala Kanda from the holy <i>Ramayana</i> written by sage Valmiki, telling how compassion and divine guidance led him to create this eternal story.</p>",
"**<u>The Third Chapter of Bala Kanda: Sage Valmiki Sees the Life of Rama in His Mind</u>** <p>After hearing the full story of Lord Rama from Sage Narada, the wise Valmiki wanted to know everything that had happened in Rama’s life in even greater detail. He sat down quietly on a seat made of kusha grass, performed a short prayer, and using the power of his deep meditation, he began to “see” everything as if it were happening before his eyes. He saw the lives of Rama, Lakshmana, Sita, King Dasaratha, the queens, and the people of Ayodhya — their talks, joys, and sorrows — just as they truly happened.</p> <p>Through his spiritual vision, Valmiki saw every moment of Rama’s life, especially his days in the forest of Dandakaranya with Sita beside him. It was as if the entire past appeared clearly in his heart. With this deep understanding, Valmiki prepared to write the story of Rama — a story filled with love, truth, and lessons of righteousness (dharma) that would bring joy to all who heard it.</p> <p>Valmiki then began to write everything Narada had told him — about Rama’s birth, strength, kindness, beauty, patience, and truthfulness. He wrote about Rama’s meeting with Sage Viswamitra, his heroic deeds, his breaking of Lord Shiva’s great bow, his marriage to Sita, his meeting with Parasurama, and the events leading to his exile. He described the sadness of King Dasaratha and the people when Rama left for the forest.</p> <p>Valmiki also wrote about Rama’s life in the forest — meeting kind sages, his friendship with Jatayu, Kabandha, Sabari, and Hanuman, his battles with demons, Sita’s kidnapping by Ravana, Hanuman’s journey to Lanka, the burning of the city, the great war, and Rama’s victory. He described Rama’s return to Ayodhya, his coronation, and later, Sita’s departure. He even wrote in the *Uttarakanda* about future events that were yet to happen.</p> <p>Thus ends the third chapter (sarga) of Bala Kanda from the holy <i>Ramayana</i> written by Sage Valmiki, describing how the sage saw Rama’s entire life in his meditation and prepared to tell the great story.</p>",
"**<u>The Fourth Chapter of Bala Kanda: Kusa and Lava — The Young Singers of the Ramayana</u>** <p>After completing the entire Ramayana — a poem of twenty-four thousand verses across seven sections — Sage Valmiki wondered who could sing it beautifully. Just then, two young boys named Kusa and Lava, dressed in simple clothes, came and bowed to the sage. They were gentle, wise, and had sweet, musical voices. Valmiki taught them the whole Ramayana and trained them to sing it with feeling and rhythm.</p> <p>The Ramayana was written in such a beautiful and musical way that it could be sung like a song. The twin brothers, who looked like heavenly beings and resembled Rama himself, memorized it completely. They sang it in gatherings of sages, brahmins, and holy people. Their singing expressed all emotions — love, courage, sadness, joy, and even anger — in a touching and delightful way.</p> <p>One day, when Kusa and Lava sang in front of great sages, everyone was moved to tears of joy. The audience kept saying, “Wonderful! Wonderful!” Their voices blended perfectly, creating harmony that filled everyone’s hearts with peace and happiness. When they sang on the streets, people felt blessed — gaining joy, good health, and prosperity.</p> <p>Later, Lord Rama himself heard about these two young singers and invited them to his palace. Sitting on his golden throne with his brothers and ministers, Rama asked them to sing. As the boys sang the Ramayana in their melodious voices, the whole court was enchanted. Everyone listened with awe and emotion as the story of Rama’s own life was sung before him.</p> <p>Thus ends the fourth chapter (sarga) of Bala Kanda of the holy <i>Ramayana</i>, telling how Kusa and Lava became the divine singers of the great epic, spreading joy and wisdom through their music.</p>",
"**<u>The Fifth Chapter of Bala Kanda: The Glory of Ayodhya and King Dasaratha’s Kingdom</u>** <p>Long ago, the earth was ruled by great kings descended from Manu. Among them was King Sagara, who had sixty thousand sons and dug the ocean itself. From this royal family of Ikshvaku kings came the story of the Ramayana.</p> <p>In those days, the rich and fertile kingdom of Kosala was ruled by King Dasaratha. It lay along the holy river Sarayu, and its capital city was Ayodhya — a beautiful city built by Manu himself.</p> <p>Ayodhya was vast and splendid. Its wide roads were decorated with flowers and watered to keep them clean. The city had tall gates, beautiful houses, busy markets, and skilled workers. Music, laughter, and the sounds of drums and flutes filled the air. Elephants, horses, and cattle roamed the streets. Kings from other lands sent gifts, adding to its glory.</p> <p>The palaces were tall, shining with jewels and gold. Brave warriors protected the land — they were skilled with weapons and fearless in battle. Inside the city lived learned brahmins, noble kshatriyas, generous vaishyas, and hardworking shudras, all living in harmony. King Dasaratha ruled wisely and ensured peace and prosperity for all.</p> <p>Thus ends the fifth chapter (sarga) of Bala Kanda of the holy <i>Ramayana</i>, describing the greatness of Ayodhya and the wise rule of King Dasaratha.</p>",
"**<u>The Sixth Chapter of Bala Kanda: The Happiness and Virtue of Ayodhya’s People</u>** <p>In Ayodhya, King Dasaratha — a descendant of Ikshvaku — ruled like the great king Manu. He was wise, powerful, and deeply devoted to righteousness. He knew the Vedas, controlled his senses, and cared for his people like his own children. His city was as grand as Indra’s heavenly city, Amaravati.</p> <p>The people of Ayodhya were kind, honest, and happy. Everyone was content and had enough wealth, food, and animals. There were no liars, cruel or greedy people. Everyone followed truth, performed good deeds, and respected dharma. The brahmins were learned and generous; the kshatriyas were brave; the vaishyas and shudras did their duties sincerely.</p> <p>The city was full of strong warriors and beautiful animals — fine horses from distant lands and mighty elephants from the Himalayas and Vindhyas. The city walls were strong, and its gates were grand. Everywhere there was joy, prosperity, and peace.</p> <p>Thus ends the sixth chapter (sarga) of Bala Kanda of the holy <i>Ramayana</i>, describing the wealth, happiness, and virtues of Ayodhya and its people under King Dasaratha’s rule.</p>",
"**<u>The Seventh Chapter of Bala Kanda: King Dasaratha’s Wise Ministers</u>** <p>King Dasaratha had a council of eight great ministers who were wise, honest, and loyal. Their names were Dhrishti, Jayanta, Vijaya, Siddhartha, Arthasadhaka, Ashoka, Mantrapala, and Sumantra. They always gave good advice and worked for the welfare of the kingdom. Two holy sages, Vasishta and Vamadeva, were the royal priests who guided the king with spiritual wisdom.</p> <p>These ministers were learned, truthful, brave, and self-controlled. They never spoke harshly or lied. They knew how to manage the treasury, the army, and the people. They punished wrongdoing fairly, even among their own families. They were alert, humble, and always thought of the king’s good.</p> <p>Under their guidance, King Dasaratha ruled the earth wisely and justly. His kingdom was peaceful and full of righteous people. No one was dishonest or wicked. The king shone like the rising sun, spreading joy and justice throughout his land.</p> <p>Thus ends the seventh chapter (sarga) of Bala Kanda of the holy <i>Ramayana</i>, describing King Dasaratha’s virtuous ministers and the just way he ruled his kingdom.</p>",
"**<u>The Eighth Chapter of Bala Kanda: King Dasaratha’s Desire for Sons and the Horse Sacrifice</u>** <p>Though King Dasaratha was great and wise, he was deeply sad because he had no sons to continue his royal family. As he grew older, this sorrow troubled him even more. So, he decided to perform the holy Ashwamedha Yajna — the great horse sacrifice — to receive the blessing of sons.</p> <p>He called his learned priests and ministers — Vasishta, Vamadeva, Suyajna, Jabali, and Kasyapa — and told them about his wish. The sages agreed that his decision was right and blessed him. They said the sacrifice would surely bring him sons if performed properly and without mistakes.</p> <p>Dasaratha then gave orders to prepare everything for the yajna — the sacred horse, offerings, and rituals. He also asked his queens to begin special prayers and fasting to support the holy ceremony. The news of the great sacrifice spread joy in the palace, and the queens’ faces shone like blooming lotuses.</p> <p>Thus ends the eighth chapter (sarga) of Bala Kanda of the holy <i>Ramayana</i>, telling of King Dasaratha’s wish for sons and his decision to perform the Ashwamedha Yajna with devotion.</p>",
"**<u>The Ninth Chapter of Bala Kanda: Sage R̥ṣyaśṛṅga’s Role in Helping King Dasaratha Have Sons</u>** <p>One day, King Dasaratha’s wise minister Sumantra reminded him of an old prophecy made by Sage Sanatkumara. The sage had said that Dasaratha would have sons through the blessings of Sage R̥ṣyaśṛṅga, the son of Sage Vibhaṇḍaka.</p> <p>R̥ṣyaśṛṅga lived in the forest with his father, away from the world. He was pure and innocent, knowing nothing about people or cities. Meanwhile, in the nearby kingdom of Anga, King Romapada faced a great drought because of a mistake he had made. The sages there said that rain would come only if R̥ṣyaśṛṅga visited Anga.</p> <p>To bring him there, the king’s men sent gentle women to the forest. Through their kindness and sweet words, they led R̥ṣyaśṛṅga to Anga. As soon as he arrived, rain began to pour, ending the long famine. Grateful, King Romapada gave his daughter Shanta in marriage to the sage.</p> <p>Sumantra told Dasaratha that this same R̥ṣyaśṛṅga would perform the sacrifice that would bless him with sons. Dasaratha was filled with joy and asked Sumantra to tell him exactly how the sage had been brought to Anga.</p> <p>Thus ends the ninth chapter (sarga) of Bala Kanda of the holy <i>Ramayana</i>, describing how Sage R̥ṣyaśṛṅga was destined to help King Dasaratha have sons.</p>",
"**<u>The Tenth Chapter of Bala Kanda: How Sage R̥ṣyaśṛṅga Was Brought to Anga and the Famine Ended</u>** <p>At King Dasaratha’s request, Sumantra told the full story of how Sage R̥ṣyaśṛṅga was brought to Anga. King Romapada’s ministers planned to send beautiful women to attract the innocent sage, who had never seen anyone outside his forest home.</p> <p>When the women met R̥ṣyaśṛṅga, they sang sweetly and offered him fruits and sweets. The young sage, not knowing the difference between the forest and the city, welcomed them kindly. When they left, he felt lonely and longed to see them again. The next day, he followed them — and the women gently led him to the kingdom of Anga.</p> <p>As soon as his feet touched the land, rain began to fall heavily, ending the drought. The whole kingdom rejoiced. King Romapada welcomed the sage with great respect and gave him his daughter Shanta in marriage. The sage lived happily in Anga, bringing peace and prosperity to the land.</p> <p>Thus ends the tenth chapter (sarga) of Bala Kanda of the holy <i>Ramayana</i> written by Sage Valmiki, describing how R̥ṣyaśṛṅga came to Anga and how his presence ended the famine.</p>",
"**<u>The Eleventh Sarga of Bala Kanda: King Dasaratha Meets Sage R̥ṣyaśṛṅga and Brings Him to Ayodhya for the Sacrifice</u>** <p>After hearing the prophecy of Sage Sanatkumara, Sumantra advised King Dasaratha to meet King Romapada of Anga. Romapada’s daughter, Princess Shanta, was married to the great sage R̥ṣyaśṛṅga, who was known for his holiness and spiritual power. Sumantra said that this sage alone could help the king have sons.</p>  <p>Full of hope, Dasaratha started his journey with his queens and ministers. He crossed forests and rivers and finally reached the kingdom of Anga. King Romapada welcomed him with great respect and love. There, Dasaratha met Shanta and her husband, the calm and bright sage R̥ṣyaśṛṅga.</p>  <p>After enjoying their hospitality, Dasaratha shared his sorrow and wished for children. He humbly requested R̥ṣyaśṛṅga to come to Ayodhya and perform a sacred sacrifice. Romapada happily agreed, and with blessings, R̥ṣyaśṛṅga and Shanta got ready to go with Dasaratha.</p>  <p>As they neared Ayodhya, messengers announced their arrival. The people of the city joyfully decorated the streets with flowers, flags, and water. With drums and conches sounding, Dasaratha entered Ayodhya with R̥ṣyaśṛṅga and Shanta beside him.</p>  <p>The citizens were filled with joy to see the holy sage. The king honored him like Lord Indra himself. Dasaratha felt peaceful and happy, knowing his prayers were soon to be answered.

"**<u>The Twelfth Sarga of Bala Kanda: King Dasaratha Prepares for the Ashwamedha Sacrifice and His Desire for a Son</u>** <p>When spring arrived, King Dasaratha once again deeply longed for a son. The thought of performing the great **Ashwamedha Yajña** (horse sacrifice) filled his heart with hope. He decided to perform the ritual to ensure the continuation of his royal family.</p>  <p>He ordered that a wise and holy priest should lead the sacrifice. The king told his minister Sumantra to collect all sacred items and release the horse, a sign that the sacrifice had begun.</p>  <p>Sumantra called the most learned sages — Suyajna, Vamadeva, Jabali, Kashyapa, Vasiṣṭha, and others who knew the Vedas well. The king greeted them with respect and told them about his deep sadness — that he had no sons and felt incomplete despite all his success.</p>  <p>He said he would follow every sacred rule, and with Sage R̥ṣyaśṛṅga’s help, he hoped his wish would come true. The sages, led by Vasiṣṭha, blessed him and said with confidence that he would be blessed with four brave sons. Filled with joy, Dasaratha ordered that the horse be released and the place for the yajña be prepared on the northern bank of the Sarayu River.</p>  <p>He instructed everyone to perform the rituals perfectly, without any mistakes. The ministers followed every command carefully, and the preparations began. After ensuring everything was in order, the king returned to his palace, feeling content that the first step of his sacred wish had begun.</p>  <p>Thus ended the twelfth sarga of Bala Kanda, where King Dasaratha began preparing for the great Ashwamedha sacrifice with faith and hope for sons.</p>",

"**<u>The Fifteenth Sarga of Bala Kanda: The Gods Petition Brahmā, and the Divine Plan for Viṣṇu’s Incarnation Is Revealed</u>** <p>In the heavens, the gods gathered before Lord Brahmā and shared their worry about the demon king Rāvana. Because of powerful boons, Rāvana had become cruel and unstoppable, troubling both gods and humans alike. The gods begged Brahmā to find a way to end his evil rule.</p>  <p>Brahmā listened carefully. He knew that Rāvana could not be killed by gods or demons because of his boon, but he had not asked protection from humans. At that time, Lord Vishnu appeared before them, shining with divine light.</p>  <p>Brahmā said that Vishnu would take birth on earth as a human prince — a great king who would destroy Rāvana and bring peace to the world.

These Vanaras would one day help Rama in his fight against evil.</p>  <p>Obeying Brahmā’s command, the gods created the Vanaras through their own divine powers. They were fast, strong, and brave — capable of flying through the air, changing size, and performing great deeds.

The sage then shared the purpose of his visit — two powerful demons, **Mārīca** and **Subāhu**, were disturbing his sacred sacrifice by throwing flesh and blood into the fire.</p>  <p>Because the sage was bound by the rules of the ritual, he could not use his power to curse them. So he requested that young Prince **Rama** come with him to protect the sacrifice. He promised to teach Rama divine weapons and bless him with strength and fame.</p>  <p>But hearing this, King Dasaratha became sad and afraid. He could not bear the thought of sending his dear son to face dangerous demons.

How can he fight fierce demons?” He offered to go himself with his powerful army to protect the sacrifice instead.</p>  <p>The king begged the sage not to take Rama away, saying he could not live even for a moment without him. He shared how he had waited for sixty thousand years for a child and that his love for Rama was beyond words.</p>  <p>He asked the sage about the demons, and Viśvāmitra explained that they were sent by **Rāvana**, the mighty ruler of demons. Hearing Rāvana’s name, Dasaratha grew more frightened. “Even the gods fear him,” he said. “How can my young son face such enemies?”</p>  <p>As Dasaratha continued to refuse, Viśvāmitra’s divine power began to glow brightly. His patience ended, and his anger rose like sacred fire. The air seemed to tremble as the great sage prepared to speak again with divine authority.</p>  <p>Thus ended the twentieth sarga of Bala Kanda, where King Dasaratha’s love clashed with Sage Viśvāmitra’s divine purpose, leading to the next great step in Rama’s destiny.</p>",

His eyes blazed as he said, “O King, you gave your word to me, and now you are trying to take it back. This is not worthy of your great family! If this is your decision, I shall go back and you may live here happily, but your promise will be broken.”</p> <p>The sage’s anger was so powerful that even the gods became frightened. Then, Sage Vasiṣṭha, calm and wise, spoke softly to the king: “O noble King, you belong to the great Ikṣvāku dynasty and are known everywhere as truthful and righteous. A king must always keep his word. Breaking a promise destroys the good results of all holy acts.”</p> <p>Vasiṣṭha assured the king, saying, “Do not worry for Rāma’s safety. Sage Viśvāmitra is no ordinary man. He has the power to protect Rāma completely. He is full of strength, wisdom, and divine energy. He can even create celestial weapons. Sending Rāma with him will only bring glory to your family.”</p> <p>Hearing these kind words, Daśaratha’s heart became calm.

"**<u>The Seventy-Third Sarga of Bala Kanda: The Auspicious Marriages of Rama and His Brothers</u>** <p>On the day of great charity, Yudhajit, the brother of Queen Kaikeyi and uncle of Bharata, arrived from Kekaya to witness the royal weddings. King Dasaratha warmly welcomed him and treated him with great respect and love.</p>  <p>Early the next morning, King Dasaratha, with his sons and the sages, went to the sacred altar. Sage Vasishta announced to King Janaka that all preparations were complete and that the princes were ready for the wedding ceremony. Janaka joyfully invited them to the altar and blessed them to perform the holy rituals.</p>  <p>The princesses — Sita, Urmila, Mandavi, and Srutakirti — came dressed in fine silk and adorned with jewels. Before the sacred fire, Rama took Sita’s hand, Lakshmana took Urmila’s, Bharata took Mandavi’s, and Satrughna took Srutakirti’s hand. As they walked around the fire, flowers showered from the heavens, the gods played music, and celestial beings sang in joy.</p>  <p>After the marriage rituals, the four couples returned to their tents with blessings from all. King Dasaratha and the sages were filled with happiness as they watched their sons united with their brides. It was a moment of divine celebration for both kingdoms.</p>  <p>Thus ends the seventy-third sarga of Bala Kanda of the holy <i>Ramayana</i>, describing the sacred and joyous marriages of Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, and Satrughna with the princesses of Mithila.</p>",
"**<u>The Seventy-Fourth Sarga of Bala Kanda: Viswamitra’s Departure, Gifts of Janaka, and the Encounter with Parasurama</u>** <p>The next morning, the great sage Viswamitra blessed the princes and departed for the Himalayas. King Dasaratha also prepared to return to Ayodhya. Before leaving, King Janaka lovingly gave his daughters many precious gifts — thousands of cows, beautiful clothes, gold ornaments, elephants, horses, and servants richly dressed.</p>  <p>As King Dasaratha and his sons traveled home, strange signs appeared — loud cries from birds and unusual movements of deer. The king felt uneasy, but Sage Vasishta comforted him, saying that such signs often happen before divine events.</p>  <p>Soon, dark clouds filled the sky, strong winds blew, and the ground began to shake. Out of this storm appeared the fierce warrior Parasurama, son of Sage Jamadagni. He carried a shining axe and a glowing bow and looked powerful and terrifying.</p>  <p>The sages and kings were surprised and a little afraid. They wondered if Parasurama, known for destroying Kshatriyas before, had come again in anger. They bowed to him respectfully, addressing him as “O Rama, O mighty one.” Parasurama then spoke directly to Rama, the son of Dasaratha, beginning a meeting that would change the course of destiny.</p>  <p>Thus ends the seventy-fourth sarga of Bala Kanda of the holy <i>Ramayana</i>, telling of Viswamitra’s farewell, Janaka’s gifts, and the sudden appearance of the great warrior Parasurama.</p>",
"**<u>The Seventy-Fifth Sarga of Bala Kanda: Parasurama Challenges Rama to String the Bow of Vishnu</u>** <p>Hearing about Rama breaking Lord Shiva’s great bow, Parasurama arrived carrying another divine bow — the bow of Lord Vishnu. He challenged Rama to show his strength by stringing this mighty weapon. If Rama could do it, Parasurama said he would face him in combat.</p>  <p>King Dasaratha became very anxious. He folded his hands and begged Parasurama not to harm his young sons. But Parasurama, proud of his own power, continued to speak to Rama. He explained that there were two famous bows — one of Shiva and the other of Vishnu — both unmatched in power.</p>  <p>He then told how long ago, the gods had tested these two bows, leading to a mighty battle between Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. The earth and heavens trembled, and in the end, Vishnu’s strength overcame, proving his supreme power. Shiva then gave his bow to King Devarata of Videha, and the bow later came to Janaka’s family.</p>  <p>Parasurama described his own heroic deeds — defeating King Kartaveerya, destroying wicked Kshatriyas, and offering the earth to Sage Kashyapa. After retiring to Mount Mahendra, he had come to challenge Rama, wishing to see if he was truly as mighty as everyone said.</p>  <p>Thus ends the seventy-fifth sarga of Bala Kanda of the holy <i>Ramayana</i>, describing Parasurama’s challenge to Rama with the divine bow of Vishnu.</p>",
"**<u>The Seventy-Sixth Sarga of Bala Kanda: Rama Bends the Bow of Vishnu—Parasurama Returns to Mahendra Mountain</u>** <p>Rama, hearing Parasurama’s challenge, spoke calmly and respectfully. He honored Parasurama for his wisdom and great deeds but also reminded him that as a prince and warrior, it was his duty to prove his strength when challenged.</p>  <p>Then Rama, with divine grace, lifted the heavy bow of Vishnu. Effortlessly, he bent it and fixed an arrow to it. The entire world seemed to pause in awe. He looked at Parasurama and said kindly that he would not harm a Brahmin but could use the arrow to remove his powers or take away the worlds he had earned through meditation. Rama asked him to choose.</p>  <p>Parasurama realized at once that Rama was none other than Lord Vishnu himself. Filled with respect, he bowed and said that he no longer wished to fight. He accepted defeat humbly and said he would return to Mount Mahendra, as he had already given away the earth to Sage Kashyapa.</p>  <p>As Parasurama disappeared, the sky brightened. Sages, gods, and celestial beings appeared, praising Rama’s strength and righteousness. Peace returned to the land, and Rama shone with divine radiance, having completed this great act.</p>  <p>Thus ends the seventy-sixth sarga of Bala Kanda of the holy <i>Ramayana</i>, telling how Rama proved his divine strength and Parasurama peacefully returned to the mountains.</p>",
"**<u>The Seventy-Seventh Sarga of Bala Kanda: Dasaratha Returns to Ayodhya—Bharata and Satrughna Depart—Rama’s Virtues Described</u>** <p>After Parasurama left, Rama returned the sacred bow and arrow to the god Varuna and respectfully bowed to the sages. Seeing his father worried, he comforted him with kind words. Then he ordered the army to march towards Ayodhya. The soldiers obeyed eagerly, happy to follow their beloved prince.</p>  <p>King Dasaratha embraced Rama with joy and relief. As the royal family entered Ayodhya, the city shone with lights, flowers, and music. People filled the streets, waving flags and cheering for the king and his sons. The young brides — Sita, Urmila, Mandavi, and Srutakirti — entered their new homes with grace and devotion.</p>  <p>In Ayodhya, King Dasaratha performed all sacred duties and gave gifts to the Brahmins. The princes served their father with respect and carried out their duties faithfully. Some time later, Bharata’s uncle, Yudhajit, arrived and requested Bharata to visit his maternal grandfather. Bharata and Satrughna obeyed and left for Kekaya, after taking blessings from all elders.</p>  <p>Rama and Lakshmana stayed in Ayodhya, serving their father and helping the people. Rama’s gentle nature, truthfulness, and courage made everyone love him. He and Sita lived happily together — their love deep, pure, and divine. Like Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi, they brought joy wherever they went.</p>  <p>Thus ends the seventy-seventh sarga of Bala Kanda of the holy <i>Ramayana</i>, telling how Dasaratha returned to Ayodhya with his sons, Bharata and Satrughna departed, and Rama began his peaceful and virtuous life with Sita.</p>"
